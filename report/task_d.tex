Regarding to the cases in which clean squares can become dirty and the geography
of the environment is unknown, of course it makes sense for the agent to learn
from its experience. We think that it would be more efficient for the agent to
learn the environment, also to learn how much time does it takes for one cell to
become dirty after it is cleaned. In this way, the agent wouldn't go from cell
to cell to check for dirt, but it will wait until it becomes dirty, and then go
and clean it. This will  maximize the efficiency.
