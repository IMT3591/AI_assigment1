\section{Task C}

The rational agent looks for solutions and chooses the best one. So, I think it
should require an internal state because if it deducts point for each movement
the agent does, than the agent should remember in which cells has been, so it
won't visit those cells again, and there will be less moves. Because, if it
doesn't know where it has been, the agent will visit the same cells, and the
number of movements will increase.
