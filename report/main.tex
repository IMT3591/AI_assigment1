	\section{Reason for low performance}
		Our method for allocation dirt will allocate dirt to a cell wil 20\%\ chance
		of creating it in the current location.  This means that the envinorment
		will almost continously add dirt to the environment after the cell has been
		cleaned.

		This means that the agent basically can't clean the environment fast enough
		to have a good performance rate
