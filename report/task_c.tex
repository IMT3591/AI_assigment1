\section{Task C}
According to the book, for each possible sequence, a rational agent should
select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure. If it
deducts one point for each movement, the agent should require a memory because
it should remember in which cells has been, and it won't visit those cells
again. In this way there will be less moves. Because, if the agent does not know
in which cells has been before, it will visit them again, and the number of
movements will increase.

So, we think that the agent should require an internal state because it will
prevent the agent from visiting the same cells and it would reduce needless
movements and loss of points.
